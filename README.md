# math_parser

A simple math parser written in c. It's based partially off of some parsing code I was writing for my own shell, so it's still a little messy in some places. My plan for this is simple

1. Remove the old code irrelevent to this parser
2. Extend functionality and refine existing design
3. Either create a primitive programming language, or resume work on my shell
    
I don't anticipate working too much on this project specifically, but that could change


# Running
